QUIZ
1. Var is able to be reassigned and redeclared. Let can only be reassigned, but not redeclared. Var is also scoped within a function while let is within blocks or {}. 
2. Const is not able to be reassigned or redeclared. Const is also scoped within blocks of code, however, if they hold non-primitives (arrays or objects), then they can be manipulated at a later time. 
3. Let and const are scoped within blocks of code but const cannot be reassigned or redeclared. 
4. Hoisting is where var variables are ran first, before the rest of the code as it would usually be read from top to bottom.
